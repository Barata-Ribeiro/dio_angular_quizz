# DioQuizz

## 🌐 Description

This course project was built during the [Angular Course](https://github.com/Barata-Ribeiro/dio_formacao_angular) (Check my study repository) from DIO.me and consists of creating a simple BuzzFeed quiz-like. In this project, 
a fake data JSON file was provided containing questions, answers, and the results. A simple layout is then developed through componentization so, using everything learned through the course, 
we can iterate through the data and dynamically generate the components based on the number of questions and answers. The result is finally generated based on the number of answers given to either alias 'A' or 'B';
the one with more answers generates a component showing the data for either set alias.
